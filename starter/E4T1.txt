# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- We should remove SSH inbound rule on the WebAppSG Security Group
- We should create a private subnet inside the VPC to host the Web Service instance and allow inbound traffic from the application load balancer
- We should update Network Access Control List (NACL) in the private subnet to block inbound SSH traffic, 
- We should block traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 except from port 80 and block port 22 in particular)
- We should update the AppLoadBalancerSG to only allow outbound traffic to the WebAppSG

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Allow Default encryption
- Update the c3-app-InstanceRole-13B91VKMQ3TWH IAM role policy to only allow read operations to the S3 public recipe buckets (resource)
- Update S3 bucket policy to only allow Read operations from a specific instance.

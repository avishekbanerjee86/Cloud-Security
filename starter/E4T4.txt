# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- a. Move the web server EC2 instance from the public subnet to a private subnet
- b. Add IAM policy for S3 bucket to restrict read operation from a specific role.
- c. Create Network ACL (NACL) rule to reject / refuse specific traffic
- d. Add a NAT gateway or a Web Proxy Layer to restrict egress traffic
- e. Set up web Application Firewalls to restrict control of  bot traffic and block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorised access to the secrets bucket.
- Moving the endpoint for S3 to a private subnet would only prevent traffic coming from outside the VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No,It won't.  There won't be any  change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before default encryption was enabled. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- I have used console to perform the activities. The original cloud formation will overwrite the changes done on the Security Groups, SSH password disabled, IAM role restrictions. In order to apply the changes to the environment, the cloud formation template would need to be updated.
